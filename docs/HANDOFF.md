# Session Handoff

Continuity document for agent sessions working on Chowder. **Every session
that lands work on `main` updates this document in the same session** —
it is the delta-layer on top of the repo's own truth, not a replacement
for it:

- What is proven vs. still open: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) (with PR
  numbers). This doc never restates roadmap status; it points at it.
- Teacher Fabric architecture and slice plan:
  [`TEACHER_FABRIC.md`](TEACHER_FABRIC.md). The verbatim Priority-8
  mission brief (15 regression rules, 10-signal taxonomy, exact Slice A
  scope, slices B–J) is preserved at
  [`TEACHER_FABRIC_BRIEF.md`](TEACHER_FABRIC_BRIEF.md) — read it before
  any Teacher Fabric slice; it is the source of the non-negotiable rules.

## Current state (updated 2026-09-06)

- `main` = `ee9df2a`, CI green post-merge, zero open PRs.
- Recent merges, this session: #109 (`training_engine` evidence field),
  #110 (censored-outcome view `censored_outcomes.py`), #111 (Teacher
  Fabric Slice A: `teacher_fabric.py` + `docs/TEACHER_FABRIC.md`),
  #112 (dataset identity/scale + accelerator context in
  `intervention_outcomes.py` — closed the Priority-6 context-gap item).
- **Model program retarget (2026-09-06):** the primary model target is
  now the Qwen3.8 Native Sparse Program
  (`docs/QWEN38_SPARSE_PROGRAM.md`). Read that doc before any Qwen
  work: it pins all four parent revisions (A control `1d4bf0f2...`,
  B primary `404ea47a...`, C comparison `a58c3b53...`, D comparison
  `81c73940...`, D resolved from the DavidAU GGUF card's base_model),
  records the real architecture audit (all dense `qwen3_5`-family
  Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration, 64L/5120h, 15 MTP tensors + 333
  vision tensors preserved in every readable parent), and the blockers:
  **B (orcarouter) is gated — 401 without authenticated access; no
  weights are cached (~55 GB each, ~220 GB for all four vs ~239 GB
  fragmented free); the protected 9-dimension evaluation suite does not
  exist yet.** D's tokenizer class differs (TokenizersBackend vs
  Qwen2Tokenizer) — compare tokenizer identity hashes, never class
  names, and token-aligned signals against D fail closed. Milestone-1
  checklist in the doc is the honest gate for "underway" claims.
- Priority 6 evidence foundation: the production incident-persistence
  caller is DONE (`ExperimentCycleRunner._persist_executor_analysis`
  writes every non-cancelled crash's analysis to `execution_incidents`
  after the failure settles; persistence failures become diagnostics).
  Remaining, per ROADMAP's own list: the chronological backtest validator
  vs UCB1 (zero-hard-gate-violations check required), the EI/GPU-hour-
  aware policy itself, and the cross-model transfer mechanism.
- Teacher Fabric: Slices A–B done; Slices C–J not started. Slice B
  (`src/chowder/teacher_signal_store.py`, `tests/test_teacher_signal_store.py`,
  34 tests) implemented the decisions the orientation had locked in:
  migration 4 (`teacher_signals` append-only ledger, `database.py` now at
  `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 4`), content-addressed payloads, atomic writes
  + interrupted-write recovery, verified-or-absent reads, dedup over
  `(request_digest, payload_file_sha256)`, required no-default
  `local_cache_max_bytes` with measured `disk_bytes()`. Two refinements
  the tests forced beyond the orientation decisions: (1) the ledger
  append is *evidence-idempotent* — re-acquiring identical evidence after
  cache eviction replays idempotently (`stored_at` stays first-acquisition;
  genuine divergence raises `RegistryInvariantError`); (2) the store's
  payload-file hash is named `payload_file_sha256`, deliberately distinct
  from Slice A's `TeacherSignalArtifact.payload_content_sha256`
  (signal-payload digest) — different identities must not share a name.
  `canonical_payload()` now carries `peak_vram_gb_by_accelerator` so
  GPU-backed artifacts round-trip losslessly (no compatibility surface:
  nothing persisted artifacts before Slice B). Cache-lookups skip corrupt
  entries; `load` fails loudly. Eviction is explicit `discard` only —
  no silent policy (that is Slice D's decision). Next slice: C
  (`teacher_blackbox.py`, Regression Surgeon integration) per the file
  plan; §16.1's hit-rate experiment remains unruns until real queries
  exist.
- The expected-improvement selector (626-line module + 38 tests, honest
  "alternative selector, not shown to beat UCB1" status) is rescued on
  pushed branch `claude/expected-improvement-rescue` (`50170bd`, based on
  main). Merging it is a separate decision from the rescue; its backtest
  harness (`backtest_selectors`) is the natural base for the roadmap's
  held-out validator.

## Environment facts (not written anywhere else in the repo)

- Primary working directory:
  `C:\Users\nikma\Chowder\.claude\worktrees\claude-moe-instrument` (a git
  worktree; keep all work here).
- Test runner: `../../../.venv-repro/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest` — never
  bare `pytest`. CLI invocations need `PYTHONPATH=src` (this worktree's)
  because sys.path insertion does not propagate to subprocess workers.
- Tooling gotcha: tools that address files cannot reach paths under
  `.claude\worktrees\` (dot-directory). `read_files`/`str_replace` fail
  there; use `write_file` with the full path, or terminal reads
  (`sed -n`), or a python heredoc for in-place multi-edit with assertions.
- Real-hardware tests: `CHOWDER_REAL_ML_SMOKE=1` etc.; torch imported
  lazily (CI base jobs install only `chowder[dev]`). Local GPU: shared
  RTX 5060 Ti — check free VRAM before real-CUDA runs.
- CI: 5 fast jobs + a ~9-minute "real transformers peft cpu smoke" job.
  Watch with `gh pr checks <n> --watch`; merge only when all green, via
  `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch` — never `--admin`, never
  bypass branch protection. Confirm post-merge CI on `main` before
  reporting a session done.
- Editing files under this worktree: `read_files`/`str_replace` cannot
  address dot-directory paths; use `write_file` with the full path, or a
  temp edit script (`_slice_b_*.py` pattern: assert every anchor, run,
  delete) for in-place multi-edits. Bash heredocs get CRLF-mangled in
  transit here — prefer the temp-script route for anything multiline.
- Test count after the dense→MoE conversion slice: 1145 passed / 76
  skipped on this worktree's `main` (was 1124/71 after Phase 11
  accounting, 1082/71 after the parent-eval harness slice, 1016/71
  after incident persistence). The +5 gated skips are
  `tests/test_conversion_exactness.py` (run locally with
  `CHOWDER_REAL_ML_SMOKE=1`; all 5 pass on this box, including the
  real-parent-A stage-2 test).
- Parent A acquisition (**complete and verified**, 2026-09-06):
  `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` @ pin `1d4bf0f2ff6012fd82039f2fa52739d0dd7c60c0`
  fully downloaded to `F:\Local Models\HuggingFace\Qwen\Qwen3.8-27B`
  and verified by a **full-mode manifest**
  (`d382d54f159f7b6c6b03afac88f7f445d03385684f77ae159fa5db07d7533f59`,
  18/18 shards hashed, 51.75 GiB, verification clean; signed manifest
  JSON at `F:\Local Models\HuggingFace\Qwen\Qwen3.8-27B.manifest.json`).
  Reference it as a local model source by that directory path
  (LOCAL_MODELS.md policy). If the directory ever changes, the manifest
  verifier will catch it — re-verify before trusting a new experiment.
  Parents B/C/D are still not acquired.
- Phase 11 accounting (PR #123): `src/chowder/parameter_accounting.py`
  measures model directories from safetensors headers (stdlib-only).
  `chowder moe account-parameters --model <dir> --output <json>` runs it
  from the CLI (writes hash-recorded evidence, prints a JSON summary;
  dense models honestly report the absent a-label with the module's
  reason). Run it on any converted checkpoint before claiming
  active-parameter numbers; evidence JSON for parent A lives beside the
  model
  (`Qwen3.8-27B.accounting.json`). Measured parent A truth: 27.78B
  total; dense floor 9.78B active/token (10.21B with MTP).
- Phase 6 conversion implemented (stages 1–2 of the plan's validation
  ladder): `src/chowder/dense_to_moe.py` (stdlib-only byte-surgery
  converter; multi-shard MLP triples — parent A layer 15 straddles
  shards, 63/64 co-locate) and `src/chowder/conversion_exactness.py`
  (torch-gated harness). Two plan claims were disproven by
  implementation and are recorded as errata in
  docs/PHASE6_CONVERSION_PLAN.md: top-1 rungs are NOT init-exact
  (top-k = E is required with the stock router), and only down_proj may
  carry the ×E scaling (silu is not positively homogeneous). Measured
  init-forward deviation: f32 max_abs 1.341e-07, bf16 1.953e-03, with
  bitwise dense recovery and exactly uniform routers in both. The full
  parent-A conversion (stage 3/4, ~52 GiB output) has NOT run — that is
  a disk-acquisition decision.
- Program state (2026-09-06): parent B
  (`orcarouter/Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored`) auto-gate **cleared** via the
  account's HF token (account `NIKO42`, stored only in the local HF
  token store — never in the repo; it was shared in plaintext once, so
  rotation is advisable). Parent-eval harness landed in
  `src/chowder/parent_eval.py`. Next executable steps: author the
  protected nine-dimension suite content, then start parent weight
  downloads (B alone is 51.7 GiB; ~239 GB fragmented free across
  C/F/G/H — a user decision on placement).
- Commit messages end `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5
  <noreply@anthropic.com>`; PR descriptions end with the Claude Code
  attribution line; branch naming `claude/<slug>`; one focused PR per
  slice.

## Known hazards / local-only state

- The **main clone** (`C:\Users\nikma\Chowder`, not the worktree) has a
  stale working tree from the stride-fix investigation:
  `src/chowder/backends/transformers_worker.py` is a pre-#96 copy, and
  untracked `activation_offload_hooks.py` +
  `docs/ACTIVATION_OFFLOAD_STRIDE_FIX.md` mirror merged work (PR #92).
  Unreconciled on purpose — multiple agent sessions share that checkout;
  fixing it needs the user's go-ahead.
- Three agent worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` besides the primary
  one; `agent-ae537f2ed08ff8828` (on `feature/intervention-outcomes`)
  has unaudited dirty state — same rescue-before-prune caution as the EI
  selector needed.
- `agent-a66d39fd3e0ec3607`'s untracked EI files are now safely on the
  pushed rescue branch, so that worktree is prunable.

## Update rule

When you finish a session that changed `main`: update the Current state
section (replace, do not append — old state is in git history), keep
hazard list accurate, and land the update through the same PR/CI
discipline as code. If you did not merge anything, still update this doc
if environment facts or hazards changed.
